      <description>Here are some examples of children whose lives have been transformed with help from The Barbara Project Team (for safeguarding purposes their real names are not used)
Samuel Samuel was seen in 2011. He had fallen out of a tree 6 years earlier and had sustained a spinal cord injury. He was unable to use both legs and one arm; he was withdrawn and miserable having spent the previous 6 years on his back looking up at the ceiling of his mud hut.</description>

      <description>The Barbara project was started in 2011. It came about following a visit by two health professionals from UK, Penny and Katy, who visited the parish of Bupadhengo in Busoga linked to their church &amp;lsquo;St James By the Park Church in Southampton&amp;rsquo;.
They named the project &amp;lsquo;The Barbara Project&amp;rsquo; in loving memory of Katy&amp;rsquo;s Sister Barbara who died in 2006 aged 50 from cancer. She had worked devotedly most of her life with children with profound physical and learning disabilities.</description>

      <description>Funds have been raised to complete building work for staff accommodation, school classrooms, school books and water sources in order to improve the standards of village schools. Funding for this work is largely carried out from UK. Construction work is usually carried out by a third party organisation The Henry Van-Straubenzie Memorial Fund (HVSMF). Occasional visits are made to schools in Busoga by visitors from the UK.</description>
