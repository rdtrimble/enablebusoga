Enable Busoga is a UK based Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) formed in 2014. Busoga is a region of Southern Uganda whose main town is Jinja where the mighty river Nile has its source. Most people live in rural areas where there is much poverty. Enable Busoga has grown out of a long and close link between St James by the Park church, Southampton and churches in Busoga. As its name suggests, Enable Busoga exists to help people help themselves through the transfer of expertise, equipment and finance. Through partnership with Ugandan friends and colleagues, we are active in areas of health provision, education and business often overlooked by other agencies.

## Our Foundation

As a Christian organisation we look to the Bible for inspiration. The writer of Psalm 82 instructs the people to:

> Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Rescue the weak and the needy

It is the calling of Enable Busoga to love, care and empower the vulnerable and marginalised. We work closely with and support our many friends and partners in the Anglican church of Uganda as they seek to do the same.
