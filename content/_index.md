Enable Busoga is a UK based registered charitable Incorporative Organisation (C.I.O.) formed in 2016. 
Busoga is a region of Southern Uganda whose main town is Jinja where the mighty river Nile has its source. 
Most people live in rural areas where there is much poverty. As its name suggests Enable Busoga exists to help 
people help themselves through the transfer of expertise, equipment and finance. Through partnership with 
Ugandan friends and colleagues, we are active in education, business and in other areas of health provision 
often overlooked by other agencies.

## Our Biblical Foundation

As a Christian organisation we look to the Bible for instruction. Psalm 82 the psalmist instructs the people 
of Israel: 

> Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Rescue the weak 
> and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked

It is the calling of Enable Busoga to love, care and protect the vulnerable and marginalised.

**There are 3 distinct areas of work carried out within the Enable Busoga Charity**

1. [**The Barbara Project- enabling disabled children in Busoga**](/projects/barbara-project). This work is carried out through partnership 
with a Ugandan non- government organisation (NGO) 'Family Life Education program' (FLEP). This project has 
enabled the setting up of a service to improve the lives of disabled children in remote village locations.
2. [**Enabling School improvements in Busoga**](/projects/school-improvements).  Funds have been raised to complete building work for staff accommodation, 
school classrooms, school books and water sources in order to improve the standards of village schools. Funding for 
this work is largely carried out from UK. Construction work is usually carried out by a third party organisation 
The Henry Van-Straubenzie Memorial Fund (HVSMF). Occasional visits are made to schools in Busoga by visitors from the UK.
3. [**Enabling the development of small businesses within Busoga**](/projects/small-business-development). Investment from the UK has been made into businesses: 
growing and drying local fruit; growing and planting trees; and charging mobile phones from solar panels.
