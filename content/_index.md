Enable Busoga is a UK based registered charitable Incorporative Organisation (C.I.O.) formed in 2014. Busoga is a region of Southern Uganda whose main town is Jinja where the mighty river Nile has its source. Most people live in rural areas where there is much poverty. As its name suggests, Enable Busoga exists to help people help themselves through the transfer of expertise, equipment and finance. Through partnership with Ugandan friends and colleagues, we are active in education, business and in areas of health provision often overlooked by other agencies.

## Our Foundation

As a Christian organisation we look to the Bible for instruction. Psalm 82 the psalmist instructs the people to:

> Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Rescue the weak and the needy

It is the calling of Enable Busoga to love, care and empower the vulnerable and marginalised. We work closely with and support our many friends and partners in the Anglican church of Uganda as they seek to do the same.

**There are 3 distinct areas of work carried out within the Enable Busoga Charity**

1. [**The Barbara Project- enabling disabled children in Busoga**](/projects/barbara-project). This work is carried out through partnership
   with a Ugandan non- government organisation (NGO) 'Family Life Education program' (FLEP). This project has
   enabled the setting up of a service to improve the lives of disabled children in remote village locations.
2. [**Enabling School improvements in Busoga**](/projects/school-improvements).  Funds have been raised to complete building work for staff accommodation,
   school classrooms, school books and water sources in order to improve the standards of village schools. Funding for
   this work is largely carried out from UK. Construction work is usually carried out by a third party organisation
   The Henry Van-Straubenzie Memorial Fund (HVSMF). Occasional visits are made to schools in Busoga by visitors from the UK.
3. [**Enabling the development of small businesses within Busoga**](/projects/small-business-development). Investment from the UK has been made into businesses:
   growing and drying local fruit; growing and planting trees; and charging mobile phones from solar panels.
