The [Family Life Education Program (FLEP)](http://flepuganda.org/ "http://flepuganda.org ") provides health services through its 50+ health centres located throughout Busoga. Uganda has been hit hard by Covid with lockdowns closing educational establishments and other communal activities while movement has been severely restricted. Many infections and deaths have gone unrecorded. EB has partnered with FLEP to train its health workers in anti-Covid interventions (hand-washing, social distancing, mask wearing) and in preparing for participation in vaccine delivery as Uganda expects to receive up to 27 million doses from the end of September 2021 onwards.
