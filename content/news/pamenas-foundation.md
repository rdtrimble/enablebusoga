The PAMENAS Foundation was set up by Gerald Naguyo in memory of his father Paul who was vicar of Bupadhengo Parish for many years and who sadly died in 2020. EB has provided some funding for PAMENAS to get up and running. The vision is to ‘support pregnant teenagers and reach out to the impoverished elderly people’. One means of doing this is through skilling programs. Please read Gerald’s recent report on one such program the foundation has undertaken with girls in school.
