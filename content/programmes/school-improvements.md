Funds have been raised to complete building work for staff accommodation, school classrooms, school books and water sources in order to improve the standards of village schools. Funding for this work is largely carried out from UK. Construction work is usually carried out by a third party organisation The Henry Van-Straubenzie Memorial Fund (HVSMF). Occasional visits are made to schools in Busoga by visitors from the UK.
