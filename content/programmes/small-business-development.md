Investment from the UK has been made into businesses: growing and drying local fruit; growing and planting tree seedlings and charging mobile phones from solar panels.

## Dried Fruit

The drying of locally harvested fruits such as pineapple and mango uses the power of the sun of which there is an abundance.

Each set of driers supports a number of families who can bring their fruit to be processed. Once dried the fruit is bagged and sold locally to schools and other educational establishments. Drying increases the shelf life of the fruit from a few days to several months so it can be used over an extended period. Each family bringing fruit to be dried is paid accordingly once the fruit is sold.

## Tree Nursery 

The nursery was first established in 2013 and has expanded considerably since then. It grows a number of different species such as: Musizi for boundaries;  Pine and Eucalyptus for timber, Avocado and Mango for fruit and also Coffee.

A manager and several workers are employed to look after the seedlings. There has been a considerable reduction in tree cover over much of Busoga so local residents are encouraged to plant trees to prevent soil erosion by heavy rain and to provide long term crops such as timber and fruit which will sustain families and keep them on the land. The nursery has faced challenging times such as during the long 2017 drought but has remained profitable throughout.

## Solar Powered Mobile Phone Charging

Currently there are 15 centres charging phones in the Busoga area. In general, the use of solar panels for domestic electricity including mobile phone charging is increasing all the time so Enable Busoga has concentrated its centres in more remote areas where this technology is not yet established. Mobile phones are now used by more than 40% of the Ugandan population and in remote areas people have to travel to the nearest trading centre to charge up. This involves a walk or a journey on a push bike/motor bike.  

A village centre saves the journey and provides the family hosting the charging facility with an income and some
domestic electricity. Each month, a proportion of the income is returned to a central pot which pays for maintenance e.g. replacing worn out batteries. This also provides funds to purchase kit for new centres. There is a waiting list for new centres in Busoga and we hope to establish further sites in Soroti - a remote district to the northeast of Busoga.
